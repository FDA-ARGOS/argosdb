## An Embleema and GW-led Consortium Receives $1.9M Contract to Advance the FDA’s ARGOS Project  

The updated ARGOS Database will enhance the biomedical research community’s ability to combat global biological threats, aiming to mitigate future infectious disease outbreaks while fast-tracking public health response initiatives, diagnostics tools, and drug development.

Over the past several years, FDA-ARGOS has worked collaboratively with University of Maryland, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and others to mitigate the complexities of genomic data relevant to pathogen classification and detection. To achieve this, the team developed and integrated existing knowledge on genomes to allow rapid exploration of known and emerging pathogens. Guided by feedback from regulatory scientists and researchers, the offeror plans to further extend this resource to rapidly evolving pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, with state-of-the-art analytics by developing FDA-ARGOS 2 - a resource that can assist in pathogen exploration, detection research/development, and regulatory evaluation.

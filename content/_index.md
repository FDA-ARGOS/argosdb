For effective diagnosis and understanding of infectious disease through next generation sequencing (ID-NGS), an extensive and high quality reference database is key â€“ FDA ARGOS offers a high quality publicly available database for Reference Grade pathogen sequences.

Over the past several years, FDA-ARGOS has worked collaboratively with University of Maryland, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and others to mitigate the complexities of genomic data relevant to pathogen classification and detection. To achieve this, the team developed and integrated existing knowledge on genomes to allow rapid exploration of known and emerging pathogens. Guided by feedback from regulatory scientists and researchers, the offeror plans to further extend this resource to rapidly evolving pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, with state-of-the-art analytics by developing FDA-ARGOS 2 - a resource that can assist in pathogen exploration, detection research/development, and regulatory evaluation.
